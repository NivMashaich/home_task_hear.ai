(Referring to collective policies as well). Do you intend to cancel the policy? A comparison of coverages should be conducted.\",\n    \"(Customer name)______, I will now explain to you the main coverages. It's important for you to know that you can purchase each of the coverages separately, but according to the instructions of the Insurance Supervisor, some of the coverages can only be purchased after purchasing the coverages of medications + transplants + surgeries abroad (basic health policy). It is possible to remove provided that the basic policy remains Basic Health Policy: This is a policy that includes 3 insurance plans: Medications + Transplants + Surgeries Abroad Medications Outside the Basket Coverage up to 3,000,000 â‚ª for medications not included in the health basket, coverage for special medications called 'personally imported medications' up to 1,000,000 â‚ª, without co-payment for medication costing over 5,000 â‚ª per month. Transplants and Special Treatments Abroad Coverage for performing transplants and special treatments outside of Israel, including related expenses such as flight expenses and expenses for follow-up treatments, and includes a monthly allowance before and after the transplant. Surgeries and Surgery Alternatives Abroad Coverage for performing surgeries and surgery alternatives abroad, including related expenses such as flight expenses and expenses for consultations with specialists in Israel and abroad. Surgeries in Israel and Surgery Alternatives in Israel I would like to point out to you that the basic health policy does not include insurance coverage for private surgeries in Israel, among other reasons, because coverage for surgeries in Israel is provided within the SHABAN framework. There are 3 policies that cover private surgeries in Israel, and they differ in the scope of coverage and price. If you are interested, you should choose one of the three: Israel Surgery Policy of the SHABAN Supplement type with a self-participation of 5,000 â‚ª (if the surgery or the surgery alternative is performed through the insurer) This policy is intended for those who are members of SHABAN in a health fund and it provides coverage for private surgeries in Israel, including preventive surgeries and surgery alternatives, all after exhausting and deducting the insured's rights in SHABAN with a self-participation for an insurance case amounting to 5,000 â‚ª (with a contracted provider). Among the 3 policies, this is the policy with the most limited insurance coverage (since it constitutes supplementary insurance on top of SHABAN) but it is also the cheapest. SHABAN Supplement Israel Surgery Policy without Self-Participation This policy is also intended for those who are members of SHABAN in a health fund and provides coverage for private surgeries in Israel, including preventive surgeries and surgery alternatives, all after exhausting SHABAN rights - but in this policy, the insured is exempt from paying self-participation. This policy is identical to the first one except that it does not have a self-participation limit, therefore it is slightly more expensive. First Shekel Israel Surgery Policy without Self-Participation This policy also provides coverage for private surgeries in Israel, including preventive surgeries and surgery alternatives, all from the first shekel - meaning without depending on the insured's rights in SHABAN. Among the 3 policies, this is the most comprehensive policy in terms of coverage realization since the insured is not dependent on the conditions and availability of SHABAN, therefore it is the most expensive. It is important to note that 'the coverage for surgeries is provided through surgeons who are in agreement with the insurance company only' (lists of doctors are detailed on the company's website) and it is necessary to contact the insurance company to coordinate the surgery before it is performed. Ambulatory Insurance Plans After joining the basic health policy, you can be offered to purchase one or more of the following insurance plans: Medicinal Consultations and Tests - Coverage for a variety of ambulatory medical events (not within hospitalization) including: medical consultations, diagnostic tests, pregnancy tests, surrogacy services in Israel, and more. Rapid Diagnosis - Initial medical consultation and diagnosis by a diagnosing doctor within one working day and further tests if necessary, in order to reach an accurate and quick diagnosis as much as possible: Personal Plus Accompaniment - The coverage provides medical and para-medical services aimed at accompanying the insured at all stages of the illness. Alternative Medicine - Coverage for a variety of alternative and complementary treatments with the option for the client to choose the provider from a list of contracted providers or reimbursement for non-contracted service providers. Specialist Doctor or Line - Medical consultation via an internet video chat call by specialist doctors, pediatricians, and family doctors at the click of a button. Bar Giora Hotline - Accompaniment, advice, and guidance in case a serious illness is discovered, providing a comprehensive envelope of guidance and accessibility to medical services, realization of financial and non-financial rights, support and guidance for the insured and their family. Medical Devices - Broad coverage for a variety of advanced technologies and medical devices medical technologies for treatment due to an oncological disease, technologies for pain treatment, hyperbaric chamber, medical devices costing over 500 NIS. Medicinal Services for Children - Coverage for the special needs of a child including a variety of services and coverages for emergency hours, consultations, tests, and treatments in medical and para-medical professions, learning skills development, and child diagnostic services. And it is important to note, that everything is of course subject to the policy conditions.\",\n    \"Notes for the Representative It is possible to request a payment method for the purpose of collection (without positive approval at this stage!
